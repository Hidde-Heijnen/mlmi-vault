## General 
- It was the 2nd most competitive admission rate for Cambridge postgraduate programs in 2023-2024
	- If anyone knows what it is this year let me know

## Tracks
There are 4 tracks in the MPhil: Machine learning is the most popular one. 

## Course part
I will focus on the Mphil courses

On the ML track he recommends picking one of the elective courses in the M term still, since it isn't as busy as it might appear and many electives are not available after the M term. Picking both the electives  in the L term is also possible, but there is quite a bit of coursework and project deadlines during that time. 

It is also way harder to do two half courses instead of 1 full one. 

### Michealmas (M) term
Michealmas isn't as intense as it looks like at first sight. 

Ethics course is basically nothing (4x a lecture of an hour, and no grade)
Deep learning is only graded with one exam in April, so except the lectures you don't have to do much for it during Michaelmas

NLP is kinda easy



### Lent (L) term

## Thesis
The second part of the MPhil consist of a research project. You cannot come up with your own subject, but they will give you some choices. Either from the University/Professors, but sometimes also in collaboration with external companies. You can submit your top 3 choices and they will try to match everyone's preferences. If two people have the same top pick, they will decide randomly who gets it. 

For more popular tracks (like ML) there is a bit more competition to get the thesis you want. 

Deadline previous year was the 15th of August and it is always on a Thursday in that week. After the thesis deadline you are basically done, nothing you have to do afterwards.
