## Preparation
In the summer before students arrive we will send through some preparation work to be completed before term begins. This is material for the first module and you'll go over it again very quickly the first week of the course. 

The master is very theoretical, so make sure your Statistics, Calculus and Linear Algebra are up to date.

However general reading which would be appropriate for the course includes:
## Computing
Basic Python shouldn't be that hard, I assume you've programmed before. I would recommend doing the latter two.

## General Reading
These don't seem very important to read for the theoretical aspect of the course. Maybe to understand the philosophy of the course. I would skip them unless you like to read normally, they seem like good stories with decent reviews. It might give more weight to the theory you will be learning during the course.
