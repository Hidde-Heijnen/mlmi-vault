when can we put the differentiation inside the integral

limits don't rely on the integral. and neither on the thing you're differentiating on (you can but some more conditions)

Differentiation under the integral. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_integral_rule

$x = \mu + \epsilon\sigma$ 
p(x)= N(x;my,sigma2)

recap delta function
