- **Information Extraction (IE):** A process in NLP to extract structured data (e.g., names, dates, places) from unstructured text.
  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies specific entities in text, such as:
  - **FROM:** Origin location (e.g., "London").
  - **TO:** Destination location (e.g., "London").
  - **TIME:** Date and time (e.g., "1st Dec 2020").
  
- **Chunking:** Divides text into meaningful chunks based on the task (e.g., extracting places and times).
  
- **B-I-E-O Tagging Scheme:**
  - **B (Begin):** Marks the beginning of an entity.
  - **I (Inside):** Marks the continuation of the entity.
  - **E (End):** Marks the end of the entity.
  - **O (Outside):** Marks parts of the text outside any entity.

- **Application-dependent tags:** Tagging schemes are customized based on the specific task or context, such as booking a flight.
