## Morphology

**Morphemes** smallest meaningful units of language. Words are composed of morphemes

**Affix**: Morpheme which only occurs together with other morphemes (3 types)
- suffix (unit-s)
- prefix (in-complete)
- infix (salat: write; s-um-ulat: wrote)
- circumfix: occur on both sides (berg; ge-berg-te)

**Root**: nucleus of the word that affixes attach to

**Inflection**: creates new forms of the same word: 
- bring, brought, bringing
- applies to most words in the language except some irregular forms (fully productive)
- only affect syntactic function

**Derivation**: creates new words
- logic, logical, logician
- semi-productive. Applies to some words
- irregular: the same type of change might change the meaning of different words differently
- affect meaning of the word

Sometimes there can be ambiguity
- Unlockable
	- un-lock  -able: capable of being unlocked
	- un-  lock-able: not capable of being locked
- beautiful dancer
	- beautiful dance   -er: says something about the dance
	- beautiful    dance-er: says something about the dancer

**Stem:** word without its inflectional affixes = roots + all derivational affixes
- book.shopp.ed: 
	- stem: book.shopp, 
	- root: book and shopp
	- affix: ed

**Lexeme:** set of all forms related by inflection (but not derivation) 
- (so connected by the same lemma)
- bookshops, bookshopped, bookshopping

**Lemma**: cleaned up version of the stem. Bookshopp -> bookshop

**Etymology**: origin of words, some similar words can be related

**phonaestheme:**
- a pattern of sounds systemically paired with a certain meaning in a language
	- cl-: related to a closing motion
		- clam, clasp, clip, clutch
	- gl-: related to light
		- glance, glare, glimmer, gloom, gloss, glow
- slide and slip have similar meanings, but sl- is not a morpheme

**Compounds**: contain more than one root
	- post-truth, railway, sunset

## Multiword expressions

combinations of two or more words that exhibit:
- **Syntactic idiosyncrasy**: The way the words are combined may not follow typical grammatical rules
- **Semantic idiosyncrasy:** meaning of the phrase as a whole being different from the sum of its parts

### Types of multiword expressions

**Fixed vs Flexible:**
- **Fixed:** order is fixed (by and large)
- **Flexible:** order is flexible: "put on": put on the clothes, put the clothes on

**Compositionality**: How much of the multiword expression can be understood from the meaning of it's individual roots
- **Compositional**: meaning of expression comes directly from it's parts
	- strong tea => tea that is strong in flavour
- **Semi-compositional**: partly derived from the roots, but may require some interpretation
	- Spill the beans => spilling is revealing, but beans doesn't refer to secret
- **Non-compositional**: cannot be deduced from it's roots. 
	- Kick the bucket => to die. A learner needs to see this combination of words as a complete new thing

Code mixed languages
- A speaker alternates between two or more languages in the context of a single conversation
	- 我唔sure => english word mixed in sentence

## Text normalisation
- **Not using any punctuation at all**  
	  _Eh speak english mi malay not tt good_ (Eh, speak English! My Ma-lay is not that good.)
  
- **Using spelling/punctuation for emphasis**  
  _goooooood Sunday morning !!!!!!_ (Good Sunday morning!)
  
- **Using phonetic spelling**  
  _dat iz enuf_ (That is enough)
  
- **Dropping vowel**  
  _i hv cm to c my luv._ (I have come to see my love.)
  
- **Introducing local flavour**  
  _yar lor where u go juz now_ (Yes, where did you go just now?)
  
- **Dropping verb**  
  _I hv 2 go. Dinner w parents._ (I have to go. Have dinner with parents.)
