## Morphology

**Morphemes** smallest meaningful units of language. Words are composed of morphemes

**Affix**: Morpheme which only occurs together with other morphemes (3 types)
- suffix (unit-s)
- prefix (in-complete)
- infix (salat: write; s-um-ulat: wrote)
- circumfix: occur on both sides (berg; ge-berg-te)

**Root**: nucleus of the word that affixes attach to

**Inflection**: creates new forms of the same word: 
- bring, brought, bringing
- applies to most words in the language except some irregular forms (fully productive)
- only affect syntactic function

**Derivation**: creates new words
- logic, logical, logician
- semi-productive. Applies to some words
- irregular: the same type of change might change the meaning of different words differently
- affect meaning of the word
