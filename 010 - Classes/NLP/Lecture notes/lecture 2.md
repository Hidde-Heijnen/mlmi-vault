## Morphology

**Morphemes** smallest meaningful units of language. Words are composed of morphemes

**Affix**: Morpheme which only occurs together with other morphemes (3 types)
- suffix (unit-s)
- prefix (in-complete)
- infix (salat: write; s-um-ulat: wrote)
- circumfix: occur on both sides (berg; ge-berg-te)

**Root**: nucleus of the word that affixes attach to

**Inflection**: creates new forms of the same word: 
- bring, brought, bringing
- applies to most words in the language except some irregular forms (fully productive)
- only affect syntactic function

**Derivation**: creates new words
- logic, logical, logician
- semi-productive. Applies to some words
- irregular: the same type of change might change the meaning of different words differently
- affect meaning of the word

Sometimes there can be ambiguity
- Unlockable
	- un-lock  -able: capable of being unlocked
	- un-  lock-able: not capable of being locked
- beautiful dancer
	- beautiful dance   -er: says something about the dance
	- beautiful    dance-er: says something about the dancer

**Stem:** word without its inflectional affixes = roots + all derivational affixes
- book.shopp.ed: 
	- stem: book.shopp, 
	- root: book and shopp
	- affix: ed

**Lexeme:** set of all forms related by inflection (but not derivation) 
- (so connected by the same lemma)
- bookshops, bookshopped, bookshopping

**Lemma**: cleaned up version of the stem. Bookshopp -> bookshop

**Etymology**: origin of words, some similar words can be related

**phonaestheme:**
- a pattern of sounds systemically paired with a certain meaning in a language
	- cl-: related to a closing motion
		- clam, clasp, clip, clutch
	- gl-: related to light
		- glance, glare, glimmer, gloom, gloss, glow
- slide and slip have similar meanings, but sl- is not a morpheme
