This course will do breadth over depth.

The definition of what is a language is not obvious

For example in the Cambridge dictionary
Word is used to define language, and word is defined using language. 

Formal languages, precise definition:
A string of length $n$ over an

A string of length $n$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is an ordered $n$-tuple of elements of $Î£$.
- $\Sigma^*$ denotes the set of all strings over $\Sigma$ of finite length.
- Given an alphabet $\Sigma$ any subset of $\Sigma^*$ is a formal language over alphabet $\Sigma$ 

Is it adequate to characterise a natural language in the same way?

We want to make some model to understand the human language. 

## Goal and scope
Build a computational system that can be used for communication, that mirrors how humans use human language

For example that a machine can understand what we want to do from our language. (so from natural language to machine instructions)

### Aristotle's Syllogism
aka implications. Language goes beyond communication. We can infer things from previous language. 
1. All men are mortal 
2. Socrates is a man 
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal
