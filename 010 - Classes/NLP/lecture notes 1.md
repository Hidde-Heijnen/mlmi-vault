This course will do breadth over depth.

The definition of what is a language is not obvious

For example in the Cambridge dictionary
Word is used to define language, and word is defined using language. 

Formal languages, precise definition:
A string of length $n$ over an

A string of length $n$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is an ordered $n$-tuple of elements of $Î£$.
- $\Sigma^*$ denotes the set of all strings over $\Sigma$ of finite length.
- Given an alphabet $\Sigma$ any subset of $\Sigma^*$ is a formal language over alphabet $\Sigma$ 

Is it adequate to characterise a natural language in the same way?

We want to make some model to understand the human language. 

## Goal and scope
Build a computational system that can be used for communication, that mirrors how humans use human language

For example that a machine can understand what we want to do from our language. (so from natural language to machine instructions)

### Aristotle's Syllogism
aka implications. Language goes beyond communication. We can infer things from previous language. 
1. All men are mortal 
2. Socrates is a man 
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal

## Topics in this course
What does it mean to know a language?
Sentence structure

Morphology: -  the structure of words

#### What does it mean to *know* a language?
- **Example Sentence**: *Some yinkish dripners blorked quastofically into the nindin with the pidibs.*
- Key points derived from the example:
  - A **BLORK** event occurred in the **PAST**.
  - The **AGENT** of **BLORK** is **dripners**.
  - The **dripners** are **YINKISH**.
  - **SOME** but **NOT ALL** dripners **blorked**.
  - **WITH THE PIDIBS** might discuss **NINDIN** or **BLORK**.

#### Structuring a Sentence
- **Lexical Semantics**: Meaning of individual words (e.g., *yinkish* = ADJ, *dripners* = NOUN, *blorked* = VERB).
- **Compositional Semantics**: Meaning derived from sentence structure (combining syntax and word meanings).
- **Syntax**: Sentence structure, e.g., word order (subject, object, verb).
- **Morphology**: Word structure (e.g., *quastofically* is derived from *quastofy* + *-cal* + *-ly*; *pidibs* = *pidib* + *-s*).
- **Vectorization**: Words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are vectorized for processing.
