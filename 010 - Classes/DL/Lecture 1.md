What is AI?

Input x => program $(x, \theta)$ => output $\omega$
- $\theta$ is our parameters, which decide how good our model will be. 
- Classical algorithms have manually implemented rules
	- Other option is to use ML, which uses data (examples) in the form of pairs of inputs and sometimes outputs and let the model 'learn' by identifiying patterns. 
	- Traditionally ML require feature engineering, where the programmer has to decide which features are important for the predictions, and the performance will rely on how important those features really are for solving the problem.
	- DL is ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers, that automatically learn which features are important, it thrives on large datasets, the more data it has, the better it performs. 
	- Input layer takes the input $x$, output layer gives $\omega$, the hidden layers tune the parameters themselves. 
	- Chatgpt is a massive neural network

Initially 1 hidden layer, were okish, not very special. Later more data, bigger models. Worked much better in practice. 

## Structured data (vectorial data)
