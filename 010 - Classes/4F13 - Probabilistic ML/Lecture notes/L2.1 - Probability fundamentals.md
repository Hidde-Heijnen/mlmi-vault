## Just two rules of probability theory

The **sum rule** states that  
$p(A) = \sum_B p(A, B), \quad \text{or} \quad p(A) = \int_B p(A, B) dB,$  
for discrete and continuous variables. Sometimes called **marginalisation**.

The **product rule** states that  
$p(A, B) = p(A | B) p(B).$

It follows directly from the definition of **conditional probability**, and leads to **Bayes' rule:**
$$p(A | B) p(B) = p(A, B) = p(B | A) p(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad p(A | B) = \frac{p(B | A) p(A)}{p(B)}.$$
Special case:  
If $A$ and $B$ are **independent**, $p(A | B) = p(A)$, and thus $p(A, B) = p(A) p(B)$.
