Dataset $\mathcal{D}={x_i, x_i}_{n=1}^N$
**Regression Goal:** predict target $y_*$ from new input $x_*$
**Amount of input features**: How many dimensions our y's have. 

We can do this prediction by fitting a line through our model based on our data, so we can predict $y_*$ with $f(x_*)$
$$
f_\textbf{w}(x) = w_0 + w_1x + w_3x^2 + \dots + w_Mx^M
$$
$w_j$ are the **parameters** of this **model** $f(x)$

Questions arise:
- What degree should we pick for the polynomial (model structure)
- How do we choose the weights (model parameters)

## Fitting model params
For each training point measure the squared error
$$
e^2_i = (y_i-f(x_i))^2
$$
find the parameters that minimise the sum of these errors across datapoints
$$
\mathcal{E}(\textbf{w}) = \sum_N e^2_i
$$
$f_\textbf{w}(x)$ is a function o
