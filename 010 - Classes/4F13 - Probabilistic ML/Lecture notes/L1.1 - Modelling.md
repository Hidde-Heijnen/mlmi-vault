## Purpose of Models
---
- Predict future data based on past data
- Often predictions are inherently uncertain. In **probabilistic models** probabilities express the confidence of predictions

Different tasks require different models. Useful models focus on some aspects and
neglect others, to trade off **accuracy with simplicity and interpretability**.

## Model origin
---
Models can originate from various sources, such as:
- **First principles**: For example, Newtonian mechanics models planetary motion with high accuracy.
- **Observations/data**: Like production of timber is based on geographical location and climate factors. 

Most practical models incorporate both first principles and data.  

**Machine learning** refers to the practice of building models that heavily rely on data.

### Knowledge, Assumptions, and Simplifying Assumptions
--- 
Model depends on assumptions
- **Knowledge**: Distance is always non-negative
- **Assumptions**: assumption that may be true or false (like gender pay gap)
- **Simplifying assumptions**: Something that is not necessarily true, but good enough to not distort the model's use case.
	- Simplifying assumptions make models easier to use, but conclusions depend on the validity of these assumptions. 

### Observations, Parameters, and Latent Variables

This time series model repeats for $t = 1, \dots, T$. It includes:
- **Observations**: $y$ (shaded) for each time point.
- **Latent variables**: $x$ (unobserved/hidden).
- **Parameters**: $A$ (transitions) and $C$ (emissions).

Using the model involves determining how to handle unobserved quantities, referred to as **learning** or **training** a model. Options include **inference**, **estimation**, **sampling**, and **marginalisation**.

The difference between **latent variables** and **parameters** is that the number of latent variables grows with observations, while the number of parameters remains constant.

### Practical Modelling
---
We make a model by combining the structure, priors (assumptions) and pre-specified parameters. 
- Handle unobserved quantities (training), including:
	- Latent variables
	- Parameters
	- Possibly aspects of the model structure
- Make predictions on test cases
- Interpret the trained model: what insights does the model provide?
- Evaluate the model's accuracy:
	- **Note**: Accuracy on training and test sets may systematically differ.
- Perform model selection and criticism:
	- Choose between different models or variants.
	- Identify the model's limitations.

### A Common Misunderstanding
--- 
The role of a model is to make predictions and provide insights into certain aspects of the data. It is **not** meant to be a complete description of all aspects of the data (only the data itself can do that).

From this perspective, terms like **true model** or **correct model** are **meaningless** in the context of machine learning.

	Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.
