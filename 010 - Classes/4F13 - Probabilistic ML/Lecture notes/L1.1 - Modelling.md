### Purpose of Models

Mathematical models serve various purposes, including:
- Making predictions, often with uncertainty, as seen in **probabilistic models** where probabilities indicate confidence.
- Generalising from training data to new test cases (interpolation and extrapolation).
- Understanding and interpreting statistical relationships.
- Evaluating the probability of hypotheses.
- Compressing or summarising data.
- Generating more data from similar distributions.

Different tasks require different models, balancing **accuracy**, **simplicity**, and **interpretability**.

## Model origin

Models can originate from various sources, such as:
- **First principles**: For example, Newtonian mechanics models planetary motion with high accuracy.
- **Observations/data**: For instance, timber production can be modelled based on geographic and climatic data.

Most practical models incorporate both first principles and data.  

**Machine learning** refers to the theory and practice of building models that heavily rely on data.

### Knowledge, Assumptions, and Simplifying Assumptions

Every model depends on assumptions, either explicit or implicit, such as:
- **Knowledge**: For example, a distance measurement must always be non-negative.
- **Assumptions**: An example is assuming income is independent of gender given age and profession, which may or may not be true.
- **Simplifying assumptions**: For instance, assuming a drug's effect depends linearly on dosage. This might not be strictly true, but is often "good enough" for practical purposes.

Probabilistic models use **priors** to express beliefs about the model. Simplifying assumptions make models easier to use, but conclusions depend on the validity of these assumptions. Practical modelling balances expressivity and computational simplicity.

### Observations, Parameters, and Latent Variables

This time series model repeats for $t = 1, \dots, T$. It includes:
- **Observations**: $y$ (shaded) for each time point.
- **Latent variables**: $x$ (unobserved/hidden).
- **Parameters**: $A$ (transitions) and $C$ (emissions).

Using the model involves determining how to handle unobserved quantities, referred to as **learning** or **training** a model. Options include **inference**, **estimation**, **sampling**, and **marginalisation**.

The difference between **latent variables** and **parameters** is that the number of latent variables grows with observations, while the number of parameters remains constant.
