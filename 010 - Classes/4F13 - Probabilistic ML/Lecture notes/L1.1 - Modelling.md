## Purpose of Models
---
- Predict future unseen data based on past data
- See the patterns and generalisations in the data. 
- Predictions are often uncertain. **Probabilistic models** use probabilities to express confidence.

Different tasks require different models. Useful models balance **accuracy with simplicity and interpretability**.

## Model Origin
---
Models can come from:
- **First principles**: e.g., Newtonian mechanics models planetary motion.
- **Observations/data**: e.g., timber production based on geography and climate.

Practical models often combine first principles with data.

**Machine learning** builds models heavily based on data.

### Knowledge, Assumptions, and Simplifying Assumptions
---
Model assumptions:
- **Knowledge**: e.g., distance is always non-negative.
- **Assumptions**: May be true or false (e.g., gender pay gap).
- **Simplifying assumptions**: Not always true, but sufficient for the model's purpose.

Simplifying assumptions make models easier to use, but conclusions depend on their validity.

### Observations, Parameters, and Latent Variables

This time series model runs for $t = 1, \dots, T$:
- **Observations**: $y$ (shaded).
- **Latent variables**: $x$ (unobserved/hidden).
- **Parameters**: $A$ (transitions) and $C$ (emissions).

Model training involves handling unobserved quantities via **inference**, **estimation**, **sampling**, or **marginalisation**.

**Latent variables** increase with observations, while **parameters** remain constant.

### Practical Modelling
---
Building a model involves:
- Structure, priors (assumptions), pre-specified parameters
- Handling unobserved quantities (latent variables, parameters, or model structure)
- Making predictions on test cases
- Interpreting the model insights
- Evaluating accuracy: accuracy may differ between training and test sets.
- Model selection and criticism:
	- Choose between models or variants
	- Identify limitations

### A Common Misunderstanding
---
Models make predictions and offer insights into **specific** data aspects. They are **not** complete descriptions of the data.

There is no **true** or **correct** model in machine learning.
