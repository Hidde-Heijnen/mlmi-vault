## Course structure
14 lectures, 2 coursework revisions, 3 pieces of course work. The evaluation is by coursework only, all three pieces of course work carry an equal weight. There is no final exam.

This year, the exposition of the material will be centred around three specific machine learning areas: 
1. Supervised non-parametric probabilistic inference using Gaussian processes, 
2. The TrueSkill ranking system and 
3. The latent Dirichlet Allocation model for unsupervised learning in text.

The organisation of the handouts is changing. This year the material will be structured into small chunks, each containing a single core concept. Printed handouts won't be provided at the lectures, but will be available on this web site. I recommend that you don't bring printed slides to the lectures, but of course you can do so if you think it works better for you.
