$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
$$

we can write any complex number $z$ in three ways. letting $r = |z|$ and $\theta = arg(z)$, we have the following:
- Cartesian: $x + iy$
- Polar: $r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$
- Exponential: $re^{i\theta}$


In this context, \( \arg(z) \) refers to the argument of the complex number \( z \). The argument is the angle \( \theta \) between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to the point representing the complex number \( z \) in the complex plane. It is measured in radians and can be found using:
$$\theta = \arg(z) = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{y}{x} \right)$$
where $z = x + iy$, and $x$ and $y$ are the real and imaginary components of $z$, respectively. 
The argument $\theta$ specifies the direction of the complex number, while the modulus $r = |z|$ (the absolute value) specifies its distance from the origin.
