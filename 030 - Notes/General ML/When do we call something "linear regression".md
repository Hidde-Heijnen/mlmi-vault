When a function is linear in both **parameters** and **data** 
A linear relationship between the output and whatever parameters I have.  Even if it gives you a non-linear function

What does this mean??
What does it mean to be linear between the output and the parameters? That for every ouput you have the same amount of paramateres or something? or that it is linearly scaled? what does it mean to be linear?

basic basis function example:
y(x,w) = w0 + w1x1 + ...wDxD = \textbf{w}^\top\textbf{x} + w_0

generalised form for basis function $\phi$
$$
y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M-1} w_j \phi_j(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^\top \boldsymbol{\phi}(\mathbf{x})
$$
