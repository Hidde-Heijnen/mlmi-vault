## Homoscedastic
---
- The noise is constant across all data points.

## Heteroscedastic
---
- The noise varies depending on the location in the data.
- This is often a more realistic assumption in modelling.
### Example:
$$y(x) = x + \sigma(x)\epsilon$$
- $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$
- $\sigma(x) = |x|$
