There are certain tasks computers are better at than humans. For calculations or searches computers are way more efficient. But for tasks like driving or reasoning in general, humans have been superior for a long time. 

> Machine learning (ML) is a set of techniques to make computers better at doing things that humans traditionally can do better than machines. It contains algorithms that parse data, learn from it, and then apply what they've learned to make informed decisions.

We do this by looking how our human brains work, mainly looking at neurons and the connections of those neurons, and improving this network by strengthening the correct routes in this network of neurons. The neural network is trained on a lot of training data. This way it learns to recognize patterns to produce the right outputs for new inputs later. 

> Deep learning is a subset of ML that involves neural networks with many layers. It focusses on learning from large amounts of data, and is good at handling unstructured data like images, audio and text.
